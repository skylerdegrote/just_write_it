# Just Write It
A Writing Resource website for anyone interested in writing

### Author
My name is Skyler DeGrote. I am a writer, author and software engineer. I love learning and as I create this website I'm learning all new languages that I've never used before. For a list of them, see below.

### Languages Used
* PHP
* MySQL
* PHPmyAdmin
* SASS

### The Plan
I plan to include lots of things on this website that have to do with writing. First and foremost though, I must mention that I am a fiction writer so I know nothing about non-fiction writing. All the resources that I post to this website are fiction-writing based.
This is why I am going to open it up to the users! As a member, you'll be able to submit resources, blog posts, comment on posts, and much more! I'm also going to attempt to code a discussion board area for members to talk about their projects.
